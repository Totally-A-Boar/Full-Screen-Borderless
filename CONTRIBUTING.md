## Style guide
This project uses a custom clang-format to meet my preferences for clean code. It also has a clang-tidy to complement it. The clang-tidy may not be applicable to everyone as it is reliant on the IDE and linter, however, most IDEs have plugins for clang-tidy support. The clang-format can be summarized as 'a slightly modifed Chromium base.' This project follows a custom-made style guide that is a sort of mishmash of other style guides.

As a base set of rules:
- 100 column line length max
- LF (Unix-style) line endings (Git will should automatically convert everything to LF)
- 4-space soft tabs, no tab key (0x09 in the file's bytes)
- `snake_case` naming/casing conventions
- Variables should always have descriptive names unless it is a trivial value/variable
- Functions should always be cast to void if the return value isn't used (not applicable if the function returns void)
- Comments and strings should always be properly punctuated (punctiation, capitilization, hyphens, etc)
- Sort include by order of importance (for example `Windows.h` comes before `WinSock2.h`)

Files should also have a header that resembles the following at the top. This header states the project name, file name, a description of the file, any comments from authors, file version (after being in a release build), classes/structs declared or exported in the file, functions declared, exported, or implemented in the file, any macros declared or exported in the file, and, a copyright/legal notice.
